What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The git version control initialized in the repo: a .git folder appears, and changes will be tracked from now on. This is necessary as before initializing a repository, the fiels weren't tracked in that folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area acts as an intermediate before commiting a change. It makes it easier to "build up" our commit properly, plus it adds an extra layer of security if added some unwanted files.
